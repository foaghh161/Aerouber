# Aerouber
A flight booking program

From a project in the Object-oriented programming in C++


When starting the program a window will pop up and inquire the user for a path to the desired file. The window has a text field and a ‘Browse’ button.

Once the user has provided the correct path the program will run and eventually create a file and input the scheduled flights.
